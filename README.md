# **IDS/SIEM with Suricata, Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Grafana, and MailDev**

## **Project Description**
This project sets up a **SIEM** to detect and analyze network events in real time. It integrates **Suricata** for intrusion detection, **Filebeat** for log collection, **Elasticsearch** for indexing, **Grafana** for visualization, and **MailDev** for email alerts.

---

## **Project Architecture**
The setup consists of three containers:
- **Box 1 (SIEM)**: Includes Elasticsearch, Grafana, Filebeat, and MailDev.
- **Box 2 (Pentest)**: Contains testing tools like Nmap and SQLMap.
- **Box 3 (Target)**: Runs a vulnerable machine with Metasploitable2

---

## **Workflow**
Logs generated by **Suricata** are collected by **Filebeat**, sent to **Elasticsearch** for indexing, and visualized in **Grafana**. If an attack is detected, an alert is sent via **MailDev**.

---

## **Testing and Demonstration**
A command file (**cmd pentest**) is available to automatically execute a test scenario, including network scans and simulated attacks. This file helps validate the SIEM's operation and ensures alerts are correctly triggered.

---

## **Conclusion**
This project provides a **ready-to-use** solution for monitoring a network, detecting suspicious activities, and generating real-time alerts, using a fully **Docker-based** approach.
